  A lot had been said on the {\em Lights Out} puzzle game and it's variants. A
  clear connection with linear algebra exist and that connection can be used to
  answer various puzzle related questions.

	In this article we will discuss an interesting observation about the
  dimensions of null spaces occurring when analyzing Lights out. We will prove
  that this sequence is periodic and almost palindromic.
