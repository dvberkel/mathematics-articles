\section{Correspondence}

We have proven several theorems about the behaviour of $\dim\Ker
P_{r,c}$. In this section we will interpret the results in the
language of press patterns.

Let $t$ be the period of $\dim\Ker P_{r,c}$ as $r$ runs over $\N$. The
Maximal Dimension lemma says $\dim\Ker P_{t-1,c} = c$. In other words
for a $(t-1)\times c$ Lights Out board there are $q^{c}$ press
patterns $p\in\Pp_{r,c}$ such that $\phi_{p,r,c}(O) = O$.

Notice that if for a press pattern $p\in\Ker P_{t-1,c}$ the first row
is not pressed $p = O$. There are $q^{c}$ ways of pressing buttons in
the first row, hence each can be extended to a press pattern in $\Ker
P_{t-1,c}$.

\begin{lemma}
    Every set of button presses in the first row can be extended to an
    press pattern inf $\Ker P_{t-1,c}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
    for $u,v \in \N$ such that $u + 1 + v = t-1$; $\dim\Ker P_{u,c} =
    \dim\Ker P_{v,c}$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    For an element of $p \in \Ker P_{u,c}$ can be extended to an
    element $p' \in \Ker P_{t-1, c}$. $\phi_{p,t-1,c}$ only effects
    lights up buttons in row $u+1$. Hence $p'-p \in \Ker_{v,c}$.
\end{proof}
