\section{Standard Lights out}
\begin{theorem}\label{standard-complexity}
    The existance and the solution problem for standar lights out are in $P$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[TODO refer to standard result?]
    both problems use solving a linear set of equations over a suitable ring, which is polynomial.
\end{proof}
