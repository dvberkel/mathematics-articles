\subsection{Observations about Constructs}

When studing constructs one can observe the following facts. First of all,
in all the basic constructs, only the vertices which constitute a kill-switch
configuration effect other vertices. Pressing one of these buttons will switch
all the vertices in the kill-switch configuration to the off state.
This observation is the basis for the following conclusion. A construct which is
build up out of $n$ basic constructs needs precisely $n$ button presses to 
solve.

\begin{proof}
	A proof with induction on the number of (on sequences of) constructs
\end{proof}
