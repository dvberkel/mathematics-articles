\section{Preliminaries}

In this section we will make all the necessary layouts to facilitate the
proof of the fact that Lit Generalised Lights Out is NP-complete.

Our layouts will be over $\Z/3\Z$. This is not a restriction. The proof
(with slight alterations) is valid for any $\Z/q\Z$. See section
\ref{section:general} for the general case.

We will define layouts of a general type. A \emph{construct} is a layout
with certain vertices labelled as \emph{inputs} and other vertices
labelled as \emph{outputs}.

Complex constructs can be build out of simpler constructs by
identifying an output of a construct with an input of an other
construct.

The states of inputs and outputs will be interpeted in the following
way. If an input(/output) is in state $1$ it is said to be $\f$ and if
an input(/output) is in state $2$ it is said to be $\t$.

We also define a function $\mu : \{\f,\t\} \rightarrow \Z/3\Z$ with
$\mu(\f) = 1$ and $\mu(\t) = 2$.

\subsection{Kill-switch Layout}

An  $n$-kill-switch is a layout on $n$ vertices in a predetermined
state. Every vertex is connected to every vertex with multiplicity $2$.
Every vertex is in state $1$. (For an example of an $2$-kill-switch see
figure \ref{figure:killswitch}.) 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{image/definitions.1}
	\end{center}
	\caption{A $2$-kill-switch}\label{figure:killswitch}
\end{figure}

In an $n$-kill-switch every button can be pressed. Furthermore every
button has the same effect i.e. after pressing a button every button is
in the off state.
 
We can use a $n$-kill-switch to distinguish between a choice between
$n$-options. How this can be used is shown in the following sections.

\subsection{Assigners, Splitters and Terminators.}

In order to simulate a logical formula we must have the ability to
assign logical values to variables, split them to facilitate the various
logical operators and transmit these values to these logical operators.

We will now present various constructs which do these tasks. At the
center of all these layouts is the \emph{$2$-kill-switch}.

\subsubsection{Assigners}

This subsection defines an assigner. Its purpose is to signify the
assignment of a truth value to a variable.

An assigner is a layout on the set $\{k_{0},k_{1},o\}$. Vertices $k_{0}$
and $k_{1}$ will form a $2$-kill-switch. Vertex $o$ will serve as
output. Depending on which of $k_{0}$ and $k_{1}$ is pressed it will
be in the $\t$ state or the $\f$ state.

Below is the adjacency matrix of an assigner.
\[
	\left(
	\begin{array}{ccc}
		2 & 2 & 0 \\
		2 & 2 & 0 \\
		1 & 2 & 0 \\
	\end{array}
	\right)
\]

for an example of an assigner see figure \ref{figure:constructsA}

\subsubsection{Splitters}

This section defines an $n$-splitter. Its purpose is to split a signal
into $n$ channels.

An $n$-splitter is a layout on the set
$\{k_{0},k_{1},i,o_{0},\ldots,o_{n-1}\}$. The vertices
$k_{0}$ and $k_{1}$ will by used to create a $2$-kill-switch. Vertex $i$
will by the input and vertex $o_{0}$ through vertex $o_{n-1}$ are the
outputs.	

The adjacency matrix of a $n$-splitter is given below.
\[
	\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccc}
		2 & 2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
		2 & 2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
		2 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
		1 & 2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		1 & 2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
	\end{array}
	\right)
\]

See figure \ref{figure:constructsA} for an example of a $n$-splitter.

		\subfigure[$n$-splitter]{\includegraphics{image/definitions.3}}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Assigners and splitters}\label{figure:constructsA}
\end{figure}

Notice that a wire is a $1$-splitter. Furthermore by interchanging the
multiplicities of the edges to an output the input signal can be
inverted.

		\subfigure[inverter]{\includegraphics{image/definitions.6}}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Terminator}

\subsection{Logical Connectives}

A standard way to continue is to show that it is possible to construct
every logical connective by exhibiting a universal logical connective
like \emph{nand} or \emph{nor}.

We will take another approach and show an universal construction for any
logical connective, surpassing the problem of expressing a given
connective as a product of a universal one.

For that programme let $\oplus$ be any logical connective. In table
\ref{table:oplus} a general definition is given.
\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
			$A$ & $B$ & $A \oplus B$ \\
			\hline
			\f & \f & $r_0$ \\
			\f & \t & $r_1$ \\
			\t & \f & $r_2$ \\
			\t & \t & $r_3$ \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{A general logical connective $\oplus$.}\label{table:oplus} 
\end{table}
We will create a construct which acts as the logical connective
$\oplus$.

The adjacency matrix of a general logical connective. At the heart of
this construct is a $4$-kill-switch. 
\[
	\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccccc}
		2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		\mu(r_{0}) & \mu(r_{1}) & \mu(r_{2}) & \mu(r_{3}) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	\end{array}
	\right)
\]

\ref{figure:connective}.
