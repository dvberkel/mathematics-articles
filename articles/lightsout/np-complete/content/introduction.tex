\section{Introduction}
We will report on the complexity of solving various variants of Lights Out.

In general there are two problems

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Existance} does a solution for the specific instance of a Lights Out problem exist.
    \item \emph{Solution} what is a solution for the specific instance of a Lights Out problem, if it exists. 
\end{itemize}

Each section will focus on a different class of problems.
