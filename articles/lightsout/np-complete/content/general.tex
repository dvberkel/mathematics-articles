\section{General Case}\label{section:general}

We are going to construct lights out layouts over $\Z/3\Z$. In no way
this is necessary. It is clear that for every $q\in\N$ with $q\ge 3$
that the constructs can also be made over $\Z/q\Z$. One only has to
alter the multicplicities of the edges.

With a little more thought is can also be seen that a constructs can be
given over $\Z/2\Z$. The inputs and outputs have to be changed in a
configuration which mimicks the states of a vertex over $\Z/3\Z$.
